# Django ORM Mastery

What is ORM?
Objectâ€“relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between type systems using object-oriented programming languages. 
This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

In simple terms, to avoid creating, maintaing or updating the database manually, programming languages can use ORM technique to do all those tasks that can be done with a database.
